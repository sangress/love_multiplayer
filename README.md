# love_multiplayer
A multiplayer ready game made with LÖVE :sparkling_heart:

If you don't know what LÖVE is, then you must give it a try:
https://love2d.org/

## How to run
Run server module as usual with LOVE: `love server`
Run client as a usual LOVE game: `love client`

You can open as many clients as you want on the same machine (for testing and stuff).

### TBD:
[Add] issues/tasks ->
- [server] Make server "windowless"
- [server] Make port configurable
- [client] Add support for projectiles
- [client] fix bug with player duplicated on screen when going in diagonal direction
